<h1>Fixing Disk Issues for Revision 1 Boards</h1>
<p>Revision 1 of the FlashROM 99 board had a small issue that resulted in
unreliable disk access on some, but not all systems with certain disk
controllers.</p>
<p>This document describes a simple fix that converts a Revision 1 board
into a Revision 2 board that fixes the disk issue for all systems.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT:</em> Make sure you have a Revision 1 board by checking the lower
right-hand side of your cartridge board first!</p>
<h2>Fix Assembled Cartridges</h2>
<p>Turn over your Revision 1 board and locate the traces that connect the
capacitor to the resistor.  You basically need to connect the end of the
capacitor that is connected to the resistor to the <em>other</em> end of the
resistor.</p>
<p><img alt="Trace Fix" src="r1diskfix1.jpg" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, this is easily done: First, use an exacto knife to cut the
trace marked by the red line.  When done, use a volt meter to verify that
the connection has been severed.  Second, solder a short wire between the
pins marked by the yellow line.</p>
<p>These two steps will fix the flaky disk access of your Revision 1 board.</p>
<h2>Fix New PCBs</h2>
<p>If you haven't assembled your cartridge yet there's an alternative to
cutting traces, but either method will work.</p>
<p>Assemble the board as usual, except for the 1 nF capacitor.  Connect one
wire of the capacitor to its regular terminal, but connect the other wire to
the resistor instead.</p>
<p><img alt="Placement Fix" src="r1diskfix2.png" /></p>
<p>If you find it difficult to connect the capacitor to the resistor you may
also put either component on the backside of the cart.</p>
<p>This placement will prevent flaky disk access for your Revision 1 board.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>You do not need to perform either modification if you don't use programs
that access the disk drives, or if you do not experience any issues on your
already assembled board!</p>
<p>Thanks go to Jim Fetzner for pointing out the flawed wiring in Revision 1.</p>
