FlashROM 99 Images
==================


This folder contains some sample program images that are ready to use with
the FlashROM 99.

`BANKTEST.BIN` is a test program that checks if the FlashROM 99 is working
correctly.  For more information, please refer to the troubleshooting
section of the manual.

Please note that images marked with `32k` require a TI 99 with 32K RAM
expansion.
